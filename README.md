eHab_grasspy
============

eHabitat script for calculating HRI values and maps of [protected areas](http://ehabitat-wps.jrc.ec.europa.eu/dopa_explorer/) using GRASS GIS and Python for computation, as a fastest alternative to the eHabitat R library.

The main script under development is the "pygrass_mkl_mahal2.py" and it will be documented together with other scripts.
